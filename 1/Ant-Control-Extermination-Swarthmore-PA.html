Non-chemical approaches of pest avoidance can be carried out in-house to successfully and securely avoid invasions. In addition, pests control companies look after everything, including cleaning out the dead pests. Earlier models of incorporated pest management (IPM) concentrated on environmental aspects of pest management.</p>

To lessen possible damage to advantageous insects, restrict your spraying to small areas where you can see pests lurking, and leave a couple of unsprayed "refuges" for any excellent bugs you can't see.</p>
