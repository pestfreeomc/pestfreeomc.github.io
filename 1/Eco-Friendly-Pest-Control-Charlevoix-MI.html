The term Integrated Pest Management (IPM) describes pest control and avoidance programs that rely on several simultaneous approaches to get the desired outcome.</p>
<p>In referral to the idea of integrating making use of other and biological controls in complementary ways, the term was later broadened to accept collaborated use of all biological, cultural, and synthetic practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural opponents are naturally more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural enemies have been picked either naturally or through the efforts of scientists to possess higher levels of resistance.</p>
<p>A biological control program can prosper if these suggestions are followed: 1) correctly determine all arthropod pests, 2) purchase natural opponents from a reliable biological control provider, 3) make certain there is a consistent supply of high quality natural enemies, 4) highlight that appropriate shipping procedures be followed, and 5) acquire instructions from biological control suppliers on correct release rates and timing of application.</p>
