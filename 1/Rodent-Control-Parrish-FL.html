<p>More information is required about food-chain concentration and useful methods of removing destructive results of pesticide residues that might remain in the environment after the pesticides have actually served their purpose. Don't base pest management programs on overall elimination of a pest. Pests attack plants from all over: rodents and nematode spoil roots in the earth, snails, and larvae destroy berries and leaves coming from the ground, and birds eat up fruit and seeds attacking from the air.</p>
