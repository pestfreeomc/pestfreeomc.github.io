<p>The term "incorporated" was hence associated with "compatible." Chemical controls were to be used just after routine tracking suggested that a pest population had reached a level (the financial limit) that required treatment to prevent the population from reaching a level (the financial injury level) at which financial losses would go beyond the expense of the control measures.</p>
