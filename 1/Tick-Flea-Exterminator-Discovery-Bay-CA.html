<p>To get more corn per acre, having a solid understanding of the level of pressure and type of pests is essential for choosing the best corn qualities and agronomic practices to resolve these difficulties.

<p>In Asia, various phases of IPM have been successfully adopted in Bangladesh (rice), China (cotton, fruit crops, maize, rice, soybean, veggies), India (cotton, fruit crops, sugarcane, veggies), Indonesia (rice), Korea (rice), Malaysia (veggies, plantation crops), Pakistan (cotton, mango, sugarcane), Philippine (rice), Tadjikistan (cotton), Thailand (cotton), Turkmenistan (cotton), Vietnam (rice) (Tables 6 and 8, Ooi et al. 1991, Raheja 1995, Morse & Buhler 1997). </p>
<p>Each time the crop is searched, record arthropod pest numbers, place within the greenhouse, and the variety of plants examined. It's possible that the repeated use of pesticides might be more hazardous in the long term than the pests themselves. Ideally, these thresholds change for modifications in market prices, phase of crop development, expense of pesticides, etc., however in truth most are based upon fixed problem or damage levels.</p>
