<p>Farmers and growers have actually been frequently using a lot of these IPM methods for years or perhaps generations - strategies such as crop rotation, not planting crops in locations susceptible to pests, or using tolerant or resistant varieties. Sovereign Pest Control and its associated companies provide quality termite and pest control services each year to over 40,000 homeowners in Virginia, Maryland, Georgia, Texas, and Tennessee.</p>
