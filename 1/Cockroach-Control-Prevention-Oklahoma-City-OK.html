<p>Hey, I'm Ashley (Branding Expert) and I'm going to guide you through our 4 steps to name your pest control business. A pest control worker is often described as an exterminator.

All setting off a bug bomb" does is cover your belongings with harmful chemicals, ruin the air quality in your home or business, potentially contaminate food and other perishables, and just eliminates pests at the surface of the problem.</p>
