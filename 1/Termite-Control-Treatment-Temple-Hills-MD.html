<p>IPM approaches consist of both chemical and nonchemical ways to avoid and control pest populations from reaching financially damaging levels. In IPM, pesticides are used at the tiniest efficient dose when other approaches of pest control have failed.

The beginning point of any IPPM program is to determine which pests are a threat to the structure and its collections. Pest control technicians recognize and get rid of pests from buildings and properties. When these pests live in a small amount in any place, it can be managed manually.</p>
