<p>The clinical basis of "Integrated Pest Control" progressed over a period of about ten years, primarily amongst scientists at the University of California, Berkeley and Riverside schools. Crops are typically monocultures, consisting of a single crop species, which creates a homogenous habitat often lacking key requirements of natural opponents, therefore favoring pest species.</p>
<p>For some jobs, pest control employees utilize a mix of pest management techniques, a practice known as incorporated pest management. The cornerstone of an efficient IPM program is a schedule of routine examinations. Crop losses due to weeds, illness, and arthropods, though contested by some as a legitimate step, have actually increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) regardless of the accumulation of pest control.</p>
