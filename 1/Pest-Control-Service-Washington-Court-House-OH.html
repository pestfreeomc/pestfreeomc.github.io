<p>Think about alternative methods (aside from pesticides) to make your house and garden unsightly to pests. With IPM, you take actions to keep pests from becoming a problem, such as by growing a healthy crop that can endure pest attacks, utilizing disease-resistant plants, or caulking cracks to keep insects or rodents from going into a structure. Recent missions for reliable, safe, and lasting pest management programs have been targeted mostly towards advancement of brand-new and much better products with which to change standard hazardous pesticides.</p>
<p>IPM methods include both chemical and nonchemical methods to avoid and control pest populations from reaching financially harmful levels. In IPM, pesticides are used at the tiniest efficient dose when other techniques of pest control have failed. IPM is an ecosystem-based technique that concentrates on long-term avoidance of pests or their damage through a combination of methods such as biological control, environment control, adjustment of cultural practices, and use of resistant varieties.</p>
