<p>Socio-psychological factors consisting of logical and moral considerations were discovered to the drivers in IPM implementation in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A study of vegetable growers in Sri Lanka revealed that nearly 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications prior to pest or disease event and only 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ). A study carried out by Parsa et al. (2014) likewise showed that a lack of qualified IPM professionals and extension teachers was an impediment for IPM implementation in industrialized nations.</p>
