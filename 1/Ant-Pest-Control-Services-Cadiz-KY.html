<p>All countries acknowledged IPM as a preferable method to pest control even if it was not commonly adopted. Pests are a significant threat that damage crops and turn farmers' efforts into a waste of time and resources. Biological insecticides, originated from naturally occurring microorganisms (e.g.-- Bt, entomopathogenic nematodes and entomopathogenic fungi ), also fall in this category.</p>
<p>IPM techniques include both chemical and nonchemical methods to prevent and control pest populations from reaching economically harmful levels. In IPM, pesticides are used at the tiniest reliable dosage when other methods of pest control have actually failed.
