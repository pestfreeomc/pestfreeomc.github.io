We only use government-approved and environmentally-friendly pesticides and products for our treatments that are safe for children and pets too. Seed treatment with chemical pesticides, e.g., has become a popular prophylactic measure in numerous crops in recent years.</p>
<p>The term "integrated" was therefore synonymous with "compatible." Chemical controls were to be applied only after routine tracking indicated that a pest population had reached a level (the economic limit) that needed treatment to prevent the population from reaching a level (the economic injury level) at which financial losses would surpass the expense of the control measures.</p>
<p>In Asia, numerous phases of IPM have been effectively embraced in Bangladesh (rice), China (cotton, fruit crops, maize, rice, soybean, veggies), India (cotton, fruit crops, sugarcane, veggies), Indonesia (rice), Korea (rice), Malaysia (vegetables, plantation crops), Pakistan (cotton, mango, sugarcane), Philippine (rice), Tadjikistan (cotton), Thailand (cotton), Turkmenistan (cotton), Vietnam (rice) (Tables 6 and 8, Ooi et al. 1991, Raheja 1995, Morse & Buhler 1997). </p>

Some time just one off treatment is inadequate to get rid of the pests entirely and thus it may need several treatments, so naturally that will affect the general costs and costs of pest control services.</p>
