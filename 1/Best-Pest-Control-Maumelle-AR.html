Some termite control professionals even fix structural damage triggered by termites.</p>
<p>With IPM you'll use the most selective pesticide that will get the job done and be the most safe for other organisms and for water, air, and soil quality; usage pesticides in bait stations instead of sprays; or spot-spray a few weeds instead of an entire location. Due to any variety of reasons, including those pointed out in the Chemical and Cultural sections, compromising the effectiveness of natural opponents often permits possible pest organisms to experience virtually uncontrolled population growth and enables them to reach pest status. </p>
