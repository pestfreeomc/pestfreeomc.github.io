<p>The most reliable strategy for controlling pests is to combine techniques in a technique called Integrated Pest Management (IPM). A typical mistake most services run into is describing their business name too literally by using worn-out pest control terms like control, pesticide, management, and insecticide. The pest management market is big, with over 15,000 companies serving the general public and approximately 150,000 pest control service workers. Cockroaches, mosquitoes, ants, rodents, termites, rats, wasps, insects, lizards, mice, spiders, yellow jackets, bees and flies are frequently discovered pests in our society.</p>

In some locations, where agricultural land remains in shortage or there is a constant need for specialty crops, particular IPM practices such as assigning space for natural enemy habitats or crop rotation are not always possible.</p>
