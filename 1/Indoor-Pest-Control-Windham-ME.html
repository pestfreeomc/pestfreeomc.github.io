Issues with pesticide-intensive pest control programs (see above) are the driving force behind IPM adoption or at least consideration for its adoption at the local or nationwide level in many countries, and in numerous it has ended up being official governmental policy. The use of chemical representatives to handle either routine pest mitigation or more established invasions need to be left to expert pest management companies who are trained and accredited in accordance with state policies and health and wellness requirements.</p>
<p>Using therapeutic tools, whether biological, chemical, or physical, as the primary methods of managing pests rather than as periodic supplements to natural regulators to bring them into acceptable bounds violates basic unifying principles and can not be sustainable.
