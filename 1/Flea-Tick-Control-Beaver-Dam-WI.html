<p>Termites are such harmful pests that you want your termite treatment to result in termite extermination. Once monitoring, identification, and action limits show that pest control is needed, and preventive techniques are no longer reliable or readily available, IPM programs then examine the proper control method both for effectiveness and threat.

<p>The behavior of the pest can be exploited for its monitoring and control through baits, traps, and breeding interruption techniques (Heinz et al. 1992, Shorey and Gerber 1996, Foster and Harris 1997, Vladés et al. 2005, El-Sayed et al. 2009, Morrison et al. 2016 ). Baits consisting of dangerous product will bring in and eliminate the pests when dispersed in the field or positioned in traps.</p>
<p>This approach of pest control has actually fallen out of favour in recent years because fire eliminates advantageous insects along with the pests and can have an unfavorable effect on the soil. To lessen potential harm to advantageous insects, restrict your spraying to little locations where you can see pests lurking, and leave a couple of unsprayed "refuges" for any good bugs you can't see.</p>
