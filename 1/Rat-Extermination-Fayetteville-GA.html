<p>The term "incorporated" was thus synonymous with "compatible." Chemical controls were to be applied only after routine tracking suggested that a pest population had actually reached a level (the financial limit) that needed treatment to prevent the population from reaching a level (the financial injury level) at which economic losses would exceed the cost of the control measures.</p>
<p>Biological control has been successfully utilized in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialty crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To resolve invasive pest concerns, classical biological control method is typically used where natural enemies from the native area of the intrusive pest are imported, multiplied, and released in the new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Cock 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterile insects is another biological control method that has been efficiently used versus a number of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ). </p>
<p>Using info about pests' biology and routines, in addition to an arsenal of pest management strategies, pest control employees locate, recognize, and remove pests. However since these "sex" traps attract primarily male insects, they aren't really effective controls. This consists of mechanical, physical, cultural, chemical and biological control of pest. A regular monitoring program is the basis of IPM choice making, regardless of the control techniques used.</p>
