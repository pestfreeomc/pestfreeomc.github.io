<p>A personalized post-construction and pre-construction service to avoid the attack or control from termites. The historical and more prevalent usage of this term is limited to use of natural enemies to handle populations of pest organisms. Some researchers likewise recognized that if regionally collaborated IPM could happen, even annual management of a constant pest might be made more efficient (Faust and Chandler, 1998).</p>
<p>Part of this success came from field schools which permitted regional farmers to harness their indigenous knowledge of natural pest control to IPM (Morse & Buhler 1997). IPM is the selection and usage of pest control actions that will guarantee beneficial financial condition, social and ecological consequences 13 and applies to the majority of agricultural, public health and facility pest management scenarios.</p>
