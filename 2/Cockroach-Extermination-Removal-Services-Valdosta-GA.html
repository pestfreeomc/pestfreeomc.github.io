<p>The concept of incorporated pest management (IPM), a sustainable strategy for managing pests, has been in practice for a long time. Crops genetically crafted to produce Bt contaminants are planted in countless hectares worldwide. Freezer is also thought about a physical control and, although it does not necessarily eliminate the insect pests, it at least stops their development and more feeding on the saved crop.</p>
<p>On the other hand, natural food production applies a number of the exact same concepts as IPM however restricts making use of pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, as opposed to artificial chemicals. Other claims include decreases in pesticide usage from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into a number of crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into a number of crops to minimize the requirement for other, less ecologically favorable, herbicides. </p>
<p>There are numerous farming practices that make the environment less favorable to insect pests. IPM extended the idea of incorporated control to all classes of pests and was broadened to include all techniques. This chapter goes over various methods to maintain pest insects at tolerable levels or simply put integrated pest management (IPM). Keep pets and kids away from locations where pesticides have actually been applied.</p>
