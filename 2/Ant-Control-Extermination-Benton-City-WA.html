<p>The very best way to control pests is to make your house unattractive to them. However home pests can also be a danger to your family. When searching for a place to infest, pests choose to conceal in a place that supplies food and a safe breeding ground.

<p>It uses a mix of practices and control methods with the goal of preventing problems from occurring and minimizing the requirement for pesticide extensive activities such as broadacre spraying. Likewise, think about policies and treatments that might unknowingly introduce pests: storage practices and devices, upkeep, and housekeeping practices. The term was later on widened to welcome coordinated usage of all biological, cultural, and synthetic practices (13 ). Consequently, under the term IPM," different authors have promoted the principle of including the full selection of pest management practices together with production objectives into a total systems technique.</p>
<p>Examples of cultural practices that motivate natural opponents and dissuade pest persistence include intercropping (several crops in the very same field) to make it harder for pests to discover a host plant, planting trap crops which attract pests far from harvest crops and which can later be treated with select application of pesticides, and delaying planting times to accompany times where pests have actually emerged and died off for the season.</p>
