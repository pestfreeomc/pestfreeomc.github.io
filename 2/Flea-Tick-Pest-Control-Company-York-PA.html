<p>The term "incorporated" was thus associated with "compatible." Chemical controls were to be used only after regular monitoring showed that a pest population had reached a level (the economic limit) that needed treatment to avoid the population from reaching a level (the financial injury level) at which financial losses would surpass the cost of the control measures.</p>
<p>The determination of the appropriate cause of pest issue (understanding pest biology) and ecology is important in manipulating the environment to the crop's advantage and to the detriment of the pest. Insecticides toxic to many insects (broad-spectrum) will more adversely impact natural opponents than products that are narrow-spectrum or selective for particular insect species or life phases.</p>

No matter how well you wash the container, it could still contain residues of the pesticide and could damage someone. A long time just one off treatment is insufficient to eliminate the pests totally and hence it may require several treatments, so naturally that will affect the general costs and costs of pest control services.</p>
