Insect pests trigger considerable losses to food and fiber crops worldwide. If basic house hygiene is disregarded, the results of other types of pest control will be incredibly brief as the pests will quickly be back, and in greater numbers.</p>
<p>Integrated pest management implies careful factor to consider of all readily available plant security approaches and subsequent integration of proper procedures that prevent the advancement of populations of harmful organisms and keep making use of plant security items and other types of intervention to levels that are financially and ecologically justified and reduce or reduce risks to human health and the environment.</p>
