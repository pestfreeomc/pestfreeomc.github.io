It is very important that we develop a more active method that seeks to understand natural enemies and how they operate as a part of the environment and to promote their efficiency by use of environment management (landscape ecology) and other cultural management techniques.</p>
<p>The first line of defense in IPM is to prevent and reduce insect pest population through nonchemical techniques such as cultural practices, use of resistant ranges, correct watering and fertilization, and natural enemies. IPM thinks about the environment as a whole and considers a balanced mix of the previously mentioned control methods to produce the most reliable and least harmful strategy.</p>
<p>In contrast, natural food production uses much of the very same principles as IPM however limits making use of pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, as opposed to artificial chemicals. Other claims consist of reductions in pesticide use from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into numerous crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into numerous crops to lower the requirement for other, less environmentally favorable, herbicides. </p>
