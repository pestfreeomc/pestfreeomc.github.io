<p>Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to draw in and vacuum the western damaged plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has been suggested as an IPM technique by Swezey et al. (2007 ), the idea did not take off since growers were not all set for such an intercropping arrangement.

Non-chemical methods of pest avoidance can be implemented internal to effectively and securely avoid invasions. In addition, pests control companies look after everything, including cleaning out the dead pests. Earlier models of incorporated pest management (IPM) concentrated on environmental aspects of pest management.</p>
