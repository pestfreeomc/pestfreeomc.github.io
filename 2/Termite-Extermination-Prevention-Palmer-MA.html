<p>Do not keep too many plants or haphazard packages of documents as moisture and cellulose draw in termites. I have been dealing with Animal & Pest Pest Management for many years; I say "with" because it has actually been a real collaboration in servicing the requirements of the neighborhoods I handle. The chemical insecticides are utilized in a way that is least disruptive to biological control.</p>

Boron, a recognized pesticide can be fertilized into the paper fibers of cellulose insulation at specific levels to attain a mechanical kill factor for self-grooming insects such as ants, cockroaches, termites, and more.

Inadequate control not just results in crop losses, however can lead to their spread to bigger areas making their control even more difficult.
