<p>Biological pest control procedures benefit from the hierarchy within nature.

Some termite control professionals even fix structural damage caused by termites.</p>
<p>16 For traditional farms IPM can reduce environmental and human direct exposure to hazardous chemicals, and possibly lower overall expenses. IPM minimizes risks by minimizing overall pesticide usage, using least dangerous pesticides when there is a shown requirement, and taking special protective steps to decrease pesticide direct exposure living organisms and the environment. </p>
<p>It is really difficult to manage specific plant diseases and arthropod pests through nonchemical ways in some crops (Flinckh et al. 2006 ). Inadequate control not only results in crop losses, but can result in their spread to larger areas making their control much more difficult.
