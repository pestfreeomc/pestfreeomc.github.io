<p>Although numerous sources define IPM in various ways, previous models primarily focused on the ecological, and to some level on the evolutionary, elements of pest management (Peterson et al. 2018 ). A current IPM pyramid presented by Stenberg (2017) determined a lack of a holistic IPM technique that uses both modern-day and conventional tools.</p>
<p>Under this scheme, insect control was "monitored" by qualified entomologists and insecticide applications were based upon conclusions reached from periodic monitoring of pest and natural-enemy populations.
