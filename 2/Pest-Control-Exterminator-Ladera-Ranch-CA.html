<p>There are things you can do instantly prior to your pest control expert shows up on the scene. Even the incomplete photo of IPM adoption around the world, provided by data in Tables 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, suggests that IPM has actually penetrated numerous areas of the world to which it has brought much required remedy for the difficult over reliance on pesticides.</p>
<p>The term "integrated" was thus synonymous with "compatible." Chemical controls were to be used only after regular monitoring indicated that a pest population had reached a level (the economic threshold) that required treatment to prevent the population from reaching a level (the economic injury level) at which financial losses would exceed the expense of the control procedures.</p>
<p>With IPM you'll use the most selective pesticide that will do the job and be the most safe for other organisms and for water, soil, and air quality; use pesticides in bait stations instead of sprays; or spot-spray a couple of weeds rather of an entire area. Due to any variety of factors, including those mentioned in the Chemical and Cultural areas, jeopardizing the effectiveness of natural opponents frequently allows potential pest organisms to experience essentially unregulated population development and allows them to reach pest status. </p>
