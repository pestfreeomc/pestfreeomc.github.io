<p>A pest expert can help carry out a tailored Integrated Pest Management program for your business. This was supported by a detailed set of documents, covering authorized pesticides, the skills of the pest control operator, application sites, and application approaches, to name a few info as outlined in Chapter 1. These were kept track of on a daily, weekly, and regular monthly basis, as appropriate.</p>
<p>Because IPM program applies the most affordable management pest strategies, profitability is guaranteed for the grower or farmer. Where the threat of resistance against a plant protection step is known and where the level of damaging organisms needs repeated application of pesticides to the crops, available anti-resistance methods should be used to keep the effectiveness of the items. </p>

It's possible that the repeated usage of pesticides may be more dangerous in the long term than the pests themselves. Preferably, these limits change for modifications in market value, phase of crop growth, expense of pesticides, and so on, but in reality most are based upon fixed problem or damage levels.</p>
