Perhaps biological control is most understood for importation of natural enemies, often from the pest's location of origin, to control non-native pests (e.g., importing vedalia bettles to control cottony cushion scales which were attacking California citrus orchards).</p>
<p>This in turn prevents weak plants which are more susceptible to pests and diseases. Pest control procedures may be performed as part of an integrated pest management technique. Lots of nations have phased out broad-spectrum pesticides and fumigants.
