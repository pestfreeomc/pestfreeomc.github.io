<p>Socio-psychological aspects including logical and moral considerations were found to the chauffeurs in IPM application in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A survey of vegetable growers in Sri Lanka revealed that almost 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications before pest or disease occurrence and only 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ). A survey carried out by Parsa et al. (2014) also showed that a lack of qualified IPM experts and extension educators was an obstacle for IPM implementation in industrialized nations.</p>
