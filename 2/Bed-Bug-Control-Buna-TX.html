<p>Biological control has actually been effectively used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialized crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To deal with invasive pest problems, classical biological control approach is normally utilized where natural opponents from the native area of the intrusive pest are imported, increased, and launched in the new habitat of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Cock 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterilized insects is another biological control strategy that has been successfully utilized against a number of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ). </p>
